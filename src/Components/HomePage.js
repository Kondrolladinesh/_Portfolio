                Dapp will help doctors by providing them with a personalized
                dashboard where they can easily manage their schedules, view
                patient details, and set their availability. The app also offers
                automated reminders for upcoming appointments and sends
                notifications to patients in case of any changes, allowing
                doctors to keep track of their appointments and manage their
                time more efficiently.

                Additionally, Dapp allows doctors to generate online
                prescriptions with just a few clicks, reducing the time and
                effort required for manual prescription writing.
